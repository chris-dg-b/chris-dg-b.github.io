	<h3> The Pandemic Years </h3>
	
<p> In the final two years of my Parks Canada experience, that little life altering event happened... the COVID 19 Pandemic. With the changes in the way we had to opperate, we had to change how we
	could do public outreach. Fortunately, my colleagues and I were able to get creative and out of our brainstorming we came up with two main ideas. The first was to create the Learn-to-Camp Podcast,
	and the second was to create the video series, the "Learn-to-camp Road Trip". I was started working with the podcast team, as I had experience using Audacity, the main software we were to use for editing.
	Soon however the technical challages of video editing became apparent and I was transfered to that squad, and we were able to create some fantstic fun videos with the help of our partners A for Adventure. 
	Below are some links to the content that we made in 2020!
