    <h3>Working at Parks Canada</h3>
    <p>I remember growing up and visiting our national parks. It was always a way to escape and explore the world around us. Having the opportunity to work for an organisation that also loves the outdoors was a dream come true</p>

    <h3>My Experience</h3>
  
 
    <p><img class="imgleft" src="Thatsme.jpg" alt="Jacob and I in Canadian WW1 Uniforms">
    I worked for Parks Canada during the summers and some of the fall seasons of 2016 to 2021. These took place within mainland Nova Scotia. Over these six years, I got to be a part of some of the coolest exhibits in Canada!
    Pictured here is my collegue Jacob and I, standing guard for a cerimonial day at the Halifax Citadel. Our role was to be the some of the first contact points for visitors to the site. This was in addition to what I thought
    was the coolest part of the job!<p>
